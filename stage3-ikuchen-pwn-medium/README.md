# Stage 3: ikuchen - pwn - medium

## Challenge

Somehow our cat üêà ate all the .py. And some letters, too... Who needs brackets, anyway?

## Solution

Via netcat you get access to a iPython shell. 

iPython has some magic function starting with %, but a cat is eating your characters. 

Entering % will give following output:

```
The cat üêà will eat lines starting with `%`. Oh and btw I found out it eats the following: 
`p*[^%\x2D-\x3D\x40-\x50\x27\x5F-\x6D\x20\x76-\x7A]*,*`
```

So we are not able to use characters like * ! $ or letters o p and t

Also every line starting with % gets eaten. 

There are two known solutions
 - ll; diff -N . .. 
 
 diff compares two files, -N treats a missing file as empty. As the the flag.txt does not exists at ```..``` it outputs everything.
 ``` 
 In [1]: ll; diff -N . ..

 - encoding strings and eval

 %c encodes ascii values to a character. 102 108 97 103 46 116 120 116 gives you flag.txt and _ reuses the last output.

Oh hi there, I didn't see you come in!
How do you do?
There must be a flag lying around somewhere on this blech.
If you could be so kind and help me find it.
How do 15 seconds of RCE in IPython sound?
Sadly the cat ate some of characters while I baked them. üêà
